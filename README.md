This is working version of app: https://disneyclone3.netlify.app/

This project is a responsive clone of the Disney+ streaming platform interface, created with React, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases a range of movie categories and includes a movie slider, with data fetched dynamically from an API.

Features
- Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, providing an optimized experience across devices, from mobile to desktop.
- Movie Sliders: Movies are displayed in sliders for different genres such as Action, Comedy, and Crime.
- API Integration: Movie details are fetched from an API to populate each section dynamically.
- Navigation: Includes a clickable navbar with sections like Home, Search, Watch List, Originals, Movies, and Series. (Note: Currently, clicking on navbar links doesn’t navigate to other pages as this is a single-page layout.)

Technologies Used
- React - for creating the user interface and managing the component structure.
- HTML - for markup.
- Tailwind CSS - for styling the interface in a modern, utility-first approach.
